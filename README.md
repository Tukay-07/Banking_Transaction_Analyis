## 📂 Dataset
- **Records:** 20,000 transactions  
- **Customers:** 8,025 unique individuals  
- **Currency:** Euro (€)  
- **Period:** Jan 2023 – May 2025  
- **Metrics:** Transaction value, revenue, product type, channel, segment, credit score, income bracket, loan repayment  

---

## 📌 Key Findings
- **Middle-Income customers** are the financial backbone → 45% of turnover (€44.68M of €99.17M).  
- **Very Poor credit score customers** = 50.7% of all transactions, contributing €309.9K revenue but pose high credit risk.  
- **Credit Cards, Loans & Mortgages** are the top revenue drivers.  
- **Mobile Banking** = most cost-effective and profitable channel.  
- **Withdrawals** dominate in both transaction volume and turnover.  

---

## 💡 Insights
### Customer Segmentation  
- Middle-income customers = core client base (70% of customers).  
- Inferior credit group highly active but risky → dominates loan repayments.  

### Product & Channel  
- Credit Cards generate the highest revenue.  
- Mobile banking is the most efficient channel.  

### Regional Hotspots  
- Urban branches (Barcelona & Murcia) show the highest activity.  

---

## 🛠 Recommendations
- **Invest in Mobile Banking**: expand features (instant loans, credit score insights).  
- **Optimise Middle-Income Engagement**: loyalty programs, flexible credit offers.  
- **Manage High-Risk Customers**: risk-based pricing, real-time alerts.  
- **Cross-Sell to High-Income Customers**: promote premium services.  
- **Re-evaluate Branches**: shift underperforming ones to digital-first models.  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Data covers **Jan 2023 – May 2025** only.  
- No qualitative data (e.g., satisfaction, behaviour preferences).  
- Assumes dataset completeness and static structure.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The bank relies heavily on **middle-income clients** and **digital channels**, but is overexposed to **high-risk credit groups**. Strategic investments in mobile banking, risk controls, and tailored segment strategies can improve profitability, manage risks, and strengthen customer retention.
